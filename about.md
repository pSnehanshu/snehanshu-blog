# Hello world!

I am Snehanshu Phukon aka Paul, a fullstack web-developer and a computer science student.
I mostly do freelancing. I have worked for many interesting clients and all
of them have one thing to say, "[Snehanshu knows his job](/reviews)".

On this blog, I write about the things I am interested in, although it's mostly
tech-related stuff, but sometimes it may be something different as well, like a trip
I went for, or a language I am learning.

Want to hire me for your project? Shoot an email at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or
<a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/snehanshu'});return false;">schedule a meeting with me</a>.

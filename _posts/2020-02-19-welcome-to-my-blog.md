Hello world, I am Snehanshu Phukon, a fullstack web developer, trying to get some of your attention. As it turns out, attention is money, why not snatch a piece of it? LOL, just kidding. Anyway, I have been thinking about writing for so long, not because I like it, but because I feel like it is a necessity in today's world. More content is being created now than ever before, so here am I, contributing a few drops of my water to this magnificent ocean of content.

I am a developer, I build web applications, and on this blog, I plan to write about things what I feel like I know about. It may or may not help somebody, but it will definitely help me. Writing gives your mind a mirror to look at itself, and this is my mirror. Moreover, I feel like writing helps you put yourself out there, in-front of the people who might need your skills (and give you money). Let's see how that works out.

This is not the first blog post I have ever written, the two other posts posted before this were written years ago, in other places. This post is the first post written directly on this blog. So here I am, officially launching my blog, snehanshu.tech (I kind of like this domain). I will keep writing on this blog as regularly as possible about things I am interested in, mainly web development, OCPP (electric vehicles), traveling and learning languages (I'm learning German, yay!).

Also, I am a freelancer, so if you think my skills may help your project, feel free shoot me an email at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

See you soon!
